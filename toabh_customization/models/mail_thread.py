            ``mail.message.parse()`` for the parsing operation,

            Once the target model is known, its ``message_new`` method
            is called with the new message (if the thread record did not exist)

                matching mail.alias was found (aliases define their own defaults)

                email source attached to the message after it is imported.
           :param bool strip_attachments: whether to strip all attachments
                before processing the message, in order to save some space.
           :param int thread_id: optional ID of the record/thread from ``model``
               to which this mail should be attached. When provided, this
               overrides the automatic detection based on the message
               headers.
